Thanks for making an issue! Please have your title fit the following format so we can fix
any problems with the bot as soon as possible!

**[Feature | Bug | New Command]: \<Short description>**

Choose either Feature, Bug, or New Command. The short description should be *informative*.

### Good examples:

> Feature: 02 should reply to every message containing "02"
>
> Bug: !roll breaks when 3d-asdnflkasjdflkaa is the input
>
> New Command: !pong, where it should return detailed stats about the bot

### Things that are **not** ok:

> Bug: !roll doesn't work

The above doesn't tell us why it's broken.
